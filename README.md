## Introduction

Welcome to my Northcoders frontend project! This project is a React app, designed to allow users to browse and access news articles, as well as leave comments and votes.

This project builds on my Northcoders backend project, during which I built an API allowing users to access data from Northcoders News, including data about posted articles, comments and users. Link to my backend project is below.
